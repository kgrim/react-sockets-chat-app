#### Creating a contact
A contact can be created by clicking on the 'Contacts' tab -> then clicking on the 'New Contacts' button on the bottom left. A modal will pop-up asking for an Id and a Name. The Id must correspond to the Id given by the other users.

#### Chat example
Below are 3 windows open at the same time with different Ids. Note that at the top of the chat section are looking different for each Id. This is due to the fact that 1 chat has all the contacts added, another has only 1 contact added and the other has none. The user can also add unknown contacts to via the 'ADD' button after each unknown Id. This button will open the same module as the 'Create Contact' however the 'Id' field is already pre-populated.
